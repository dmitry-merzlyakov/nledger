<A NAME="lbAD">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>DESCRIPTION</H2>

<B></B>


is a command-line accounting tool based on the power and completeness
of double-entry accounting.  It is only a reporting tool, which means it never
modifies your data files, but it does offer a large selection of reports, and
different ways to customize them to your needs.
<A NAME="lbAE">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>COMMANDS</H2>

<B></B>


accepts several top-level commands, each of which generates a different
kind of basic report.  Most of them accept a
<I>report-query</I>

argument, in order to determine what should be reported.  To understand the
syntax of a
<I>report-query</I>

 
see the section on
Sx QUERIES .

In its most basic form, simply specifying one or more strings produces a
report for all accounts containing those strings.
<P>

If no command is given,
<B></B>


enters a
<B>REPL</B>

 
or command loop, allowing several commands to be executed on the same
dataset without reparsing.
<P>

The following is a complete list of accepted reporting commands:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>accounts </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
List all accounts for postings that match the
<I>report-query</I>

 
</DL>
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>balance </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
Print a balance report showing totals for postings that match
<I>report-query</I>

 
and aggregate totals for parents of those accounts.  Options most commonly used
with this command are:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>--basis (-B</B>

)




<DD>
Report in terms of cost basis, not amount or value.  This is the only form of
report which is guaranteed to always balance to zero, when no
<I>report-query</I>

is specified.
Only show totals for the top-most accounts.
<DT><B>--empty (-E</B>

)




<DD>
Show accounts whose total is zero.
<DT><B>--flat</B>


<DD>
Rather than display a hierarchical tree, flatten the report to show subtotals
for only accounts matching
<I>report-query</I>

 
<DT><B>--no-total</B>


<DD>
Suppress the summary total shown at the bottom of the report.
</DL>
<P>

<P>

The synonyms

are also accepted.
<DT><B>budget </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
A special balance report which includes three extra columns: the amount
budgeted during the reporting period, how spending differed from the budget,
and the percentage of budget spent (exceeds 100% if you go over budget).
Note that budgeting requires one or more
Do periodic transactions

Dc to be defined in your data file(s).  See the manual for more information.

<DT><B>cleared </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
A special balance report which adds two extra columns: the cleared balance for
each account, and the date of the most recent cleared posting in that account.
For this accounting to be meaningful, the cleared flag must be set on at least
one posting.  See the manual for more information.
<DT><B>commodities </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
List all commodities for postings matching the
<I>report-query</I>

 
<DT><B>convert</B>


<DD>
Reads data from a CSV (comma-separated values) file and generates
<B></B>


transactions.
<DT><B>csv </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
Report of postings matching the
<I>report-query</I>

in CSV format (comma-separated values).  Useful for exporting data to a
spreadsheet for further analysis or charting.
<DT><B>entry </B>[<I>entry-template </I>]






<DD>
Generate and display a new, properly formatted
<B></B>


transaction by comparing
the
<I>entry-template</I>

to the transactions in your data file(s).  For more information on draft
templates and using this command to quickly create new transactions, see the
section
Sx ENTRIES .

<P>

The synonym
<B>xact</B>

is also accepted.
<DT><B>emacs </B>[<I>query </I>]






<DD>
Output posting and transaction data in a format readily consumed by the Emacs
editor, in a series of Lisp forms.  This is used by the Emacs ledger-mode to
process reporting data from
<B>.</B>

<DT><B>equity </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
Print a transaction with a series of postings that balance current totals for
accounts matching the
<I>report-query</I>

in a special account called
<B>Equity:Opening Balances</B>

 
The purpose of this report is to close the books for a prior year, while using
these equity postings to carry forward those balances.
<DT><B>payees </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
List all payees for postings matching the
<I>report-query</I>

 
<DT><B>pricemap</B>


<DD>

<B></B>


file.
<DT><B>prices </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
Report prices for all commodities in postings matching the
<I>report-query</I>

 
The prices are reported with the granularity of a single day.
<DT><B>pricedb </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
Report prices for all commodities in postings matching the
<I>report-query</I>

 
Prices are reported down to the second, using the same format as the
~/.pricedb

file.
<DT><B>print </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
Print out the full transactions of any matching postings using the same
format as they would appear in a data file.  This can be used to extract
subsets from a
<B></B>


file to transfer to other files.
<DT><B>push </B>[<I>options </I>]






<DD>
In the
<B>REPL</B>

 
push a set of command-line
<I>options</I>

 
so that they will apply to all subsequent reports.
<DT><B>pop</B>


<DD>

pop any option settings that have been

<B>push</B>

ed.

<DT><B>register </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
List all postings matching the
<I>report-query</I>

 
This is one of the most common commands, and can be used to provide a variety
of useful reports.  Options most commonly used
with this command are:
<P>

<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>--average (-A</B>

)




<DD>
Show the running average, rather than a running total.
<DT><B>--current (-c</B>

)




<DD>
Don't show postings beyond the present day.
<DT><B>--exchange </B><I>commodity (-</I><B>X</B>

)






<DD>
Render all values in the given
<I>commodity</I>

 
if a price conversion rate can be determined.  Rates are always displayed
relative to the date of the posting they are calculated for.  This means a
<B>register</B>

report is a historical value report.  For current values, it may be preferable
to use the
<B>balance</B>

report.
<DT><B>--gain (-G</B>

)




<DD>
Show any gains (or losses) in commodity values over time.
<DT><B>--head </B><I>number</I>




<DD>
Only show the top
<I>number</I>

postings.
<DT><B>--historical (-H</B>

)




<DD>
Value commodities at the time of their acquisition.
<DT><B>--invert</B>


<DD>
Invert the value of amounts shown.
<DT><B>--market (-V</B>

)




<DD>
Show current market values for all amounts.  This is determined in a somewhat
magical fashion.  It is probably more straightforward to use
-<B>-exchange</B>

option.
<DT><B>--period </B><I>time-period (-</I><B>p</B>

)






<DD>
Show postings only for the given
<I>time-period</I>

 
<DT><B>--related (-r</B>

)




<DD>
Show postings that are related to those that would have been shown.  It has
the effect of displaying the
Qq other side

of the postings.
<DT><B>--sort </B><I>value-expression (-</I><B>S</B>

)






<DD>
Sort postings by evaluating the given
<I>value-expression</I>

 
Note that a comma-separated list of expressions is allowed, in which case each
sorting term is used in order to determine the final ordering.  For example,
to search by date and then amount, one would use:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>ledger reg --sort 'date, amount'</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
The sort order may be controlled with the '-' sign. For example, to sort in
reverse chronological order:

<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>ledger reg --sort '-date'</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT><B>--tail </B><I>number</I>




<DD>
Only show the last
<I>number</I>

postings.
<DT><B>--uncleared (-U</B>

)




<DD>
Only show uncleared (i.e., recent) postings.
</DL>

</DL>
<P>

<P>

The synonyms
<B>reg</B>

and
<B>r</B>

are also accepted.
<DT><B>server</B>


<DD>
This command requires that Python support be active.  If so, it starts up an
<B>HTTP</B>

server listening for requests on port 9000.  This provides an alternate
interface to creating and viewing reports.  Note that this is very much a
work-in-progress, and will not be fully functional until a later version.
<DT><B>select </B>[<I>sql-query </I>]






<DD>
List all postings matching the
<I>sql-query</I>

<H2>PRE-COMMANDS</H2>

Pre-commands are useful when you aren't sure how a command or option
will work.  The difference between a pre-command and a regular command
is that pre-commands ignore the journal data file completely, nor is
the user's init file read.
<DL COMPACT>

<H2>QUERIES</H2>

The syntax for reporting queries can get somewhat complex.  It is a series of
query terms with an implicit OR operator between them.  The following terms
are accepted:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B></B><I>regex</I>


<DD>
A bare string is taken as a regular expression matching the full account name.
Thus, to report the current balance for all assets and liabilities, you would
use:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT>ledger bal asset liab</TT></BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT><B>payee </B><I>regex (</I><B>@ </B><I>regex</I>





)






<DD>
Query on the payee, rather than the account.
<DT><B>tag </B><I>regex (</I><B>% </B><I>regex</I>





)






<DD>
<DT><B>note </B><I>regex (</I><B>= </B><I>regex</I>





)






<DD>
Query on anything found in an item's note.
<DT><B>code </B><I>regex (</I><B># </B><I>regex</I>





)






<DD>
Query on the xact's optional code (which can be any string the user wishes).
<DT><B></B><I>term </I><B>and </B><I>term</I>






<DD>
Query terms are joined by an implicit OR operator.  You can change this to AND
by using the
<B>and</B>

keyword.  For example, to show food expenditures occurring at
Shakee's Pizza, you could say:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT></TT><B>ledger reg food and @Shakee</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT><B></B><I>term </I><B>or </B><I>term</I>






<DD>
When you wish to be more explicit, use the OR operator.
<DT><B>show</B>


<DD>
<DT><B>not </B><I>term</I>




<DD>
Reverse the logical meaning of the following term.  This can be used with
parentheses to great effect:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT></TT><B>ledger reg food and @Shakee and not dining</B>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<DT><B>( </B><I>term </I><B>)</B>




<DD>
If you wish to mix OR and AND operators, it is often helpful to surround
logical units with parentheses.  <B>NOTE</B>: Because of the way some shells
interpret parentheses, you should always escape them:
<P>


<BLOCKQUOTE><TT></TT><B>ledger bal \( assets or liab \) and not food</B>

<H2>DEBUG COMMANDS</H2>

In addition to the regular reporting commands,
<B></B>


also accepts several
debug commands:
<DL COMPACT>
<P>

<DT><B>args </B>[<I>report-query </I>]






<DD>
Display complete analysis of how
<B></B>


interpreted the given
<I>report-query</I>

 
Useful if you want to understand how report queries are translated into value
expressions.
<DT><B>eval </B>[<I>value-expression </I>]






<DD>
Evaluate the given
<I>value-expression</I>

and prints the result.  For more on value expressions, see the section
Sx EXPRESSIONS .

<DT><B>format </B>[<I>format-string </I>]






<DD>
Display an analysis of how
<I>format-string</I>

was parsed, and what it would look like applied to a sample transaction.  For
more on format strings, see the section
Sx FORMATS .

<DT><B>generate</B>


<DD>
Generate 50 randomly composed yet valid
<B></B>


transactions.
<DT><B>parse </B>[<I>value-expression </I>]






<DD>
Parse the given
<I>value-expression</I>

and display an analysis of the expression tree and its evaluated value.  For
more on value expressions, see the section
Sx EXPRESSIONS .

<DT><B>python </B>[<I>file </I>]






<DD>
Invoke a Python interpreter to read the given
<I>file</I>

 
What is special about this is that the
<B></B>


module is builtin, not read from
disk, so it doesn't require
<B></B>


to be installed anywhere, or the shared
library variants to be built.
<DT><B>reload</B>


<DD>
Reload all data files for the current session immediately.
Can only be used in the
<B>REPL</B>

 
<DT><B>template </B>[<I>draft-template </I>]






<DD>
Display information about how
<I>draft-template</I>

was parsed.  See the section on
Sx DRAFTS .

<A NAME="lbAK">&nbsp;</A>
<H2>ENVIRONMENT</H2>

Every option to
<B></B>


may be set using an environment variable if the option has a long name.
For example setting the environment variable
<B>LEDGER_DATE_FORMAT=%d.%m.%Y'</B>

will have the same effect as specifying
-<B>-date-format </B><I>'%d.%m.%Y'</I>



on the command-line.  Options on the command-line always take precedence over
environment variable settings, however.
